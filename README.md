## Hardware setup

You need a third-party module - [Pmod I2S2: stereo audio input and output](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-i2s2-stereo-audio-input-and-output/) to properly run this application. You need to manually wire the following connections:

| I2S signal   | Kit pins              | Pmod IS2S pins |
| :----------- | :---------------------| :------------- |
| TX_SCK       | P9[2]                 |   J1.3         |
| TX_DATA      | P9[0]                 |   J1.4         |
| TX_WS        | P9[3]                 |   J1.2         |
| MCLK         | See the **Table-1**   |   J1.1         |
| GND          | GND                   |   GND          |
| VCC          | V3.3                  |   VCC          |

See **Table 1** to know the MCLK pin for the respective kits

**Table 1: MCLK_PIN selection for different targets**

Kit                      | MCLK_PIN
:------------------------|---------
CY8CPROTO-062-4343W      | P9 [6]
CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT      | P9 [6]
CY8CKIT-062-BLE          | P9 [6]
CY8CPROTO-063-BLE        | P9 [6]
CY8CKIT-062S2-43012      | P9 [6]

<br>

**Note:** Only Port 9 and Port 8 support Smart I/O. That means the I2S master can be placed only in the 0~3 pins of these two ports. Note the following when using these connections:

- On PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&REG; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE), add a zero-ohm resistor at R131.

- On PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT), add a zero-ohm resistor at R162.

- On PSoC&trade; 62S4 pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062S4), remove resistor R68 and add a zero-ohm resistor at R135.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (such as `CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W`), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.
2. Ensure that the `MCLK_PIN` macro is assigned the value mentioned in the [Table 1: MCLK_PIN](#table-1-mclk_pin-selection-for-different-targets) for the respective kits.

3. Connect a speaker or headphone to the Pmod I2S2 audio jack (green connector).

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Press the user button to play the short audio "PSoC&trade; Rocks".


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This design provides middleware files (*i2s_master.c/h*) to implement the I2S master (Tx only). It requires an SPI resource and a Smart I/O. All the initialization of these blocks are handled by the middleware. You need to configure only the clocks and pin assignment for the SPI and Smart I/O.


### I2S interface overview

The I2S Interface timing diagram is shown below. It streams audio data for two channels - left and right. The Word Select (WS) signal indicates the channel that is currently streaming.

**Figure 1. I2S timing diagram (from I2S Bus spec)**

![](images/i2s-diagram.png)

Due to the similarities to the SPI interface, you can leverage the SPI master to generate the clock (SCK) and the data signal (SD). The WS signal can be derived from the SPI-SS signal; however, it needs to keep toggling on every channel. In this implementation, the I2S channel length is 32 bits. Smart I/O is configured to toggle the WS signal every 32 cycles of SCK. It initially toggles when the SPI-SS signal asserts (beginning of transmission). Because the PSoC&trade; 6 SPI can support data width up to 16 bits only, the SPI FIFO needs to be written twice for every I2S channel.

**Table 1. SPI and SGPIO mapping**

| SPI signal  |  I2S signal  | Description |
| ------- | ------------  | ---- |
| SCLK | TX_SCK (SCK) | Clock driven by the I2S master |
| MOSI | TX_DATA (SD) | Data driven by the I2S master |
| SS | TX_WS (WS) | Indicates which channel transmits |

<br>

### Clocking

The clock that drives the I2S/SPI depends on the required frame rate. Typical frame rate values are 8/16/22.05/32/44.1/48 kHz. The formula to calculate the clock frequency based on the required frame rate is:

```math
Clock frequency [Hz] = Frame rate [Hz] x 2 x Channel length x SPI oversample
```

In this implementation, the channel length is fixed to 32 and SPI oversample is fixed to 4.

Usually an audio codec requires a master clock (MCLK). In this case, a PWM is used to generate the MCLK. This clock is usually 256x faster than the frame rate (see the audio codec's datasheet).

Table 2 shows a quick summary of frequencies to be configured in the system for a given frame rate:

**Table 2. SPI and SGPIO mapping**

| Frame rate  |  I2S SCK  | SPI clock | MCLK | Peripheral clock |
| ----------- | ----------| --------- | ---- | --- |
| 8 kHz       | 0.512 MHz | 2.048 MHz | 2.048 MHz | 4.096 MHz |
| 16 kHz      | 1.024 MHz | 4.096 MHz | 4.096 MHz | 16.384 MHz |
| 22.05 kHz   | 1.4112 MHz | 5.6448 MHz | 5.6448 MHz | 22.5792 MHz |
| 32 kHz      | 2.048 MHz | 8.192 MHz | 8.192 MHz | 32.768 MHz |
| 44.1 kHz    | 2.822 MHz | 11.2896 MHz | 11.2896 MHz | 45.1584 MHz |
| 48 kHz      | 3.072 MHz | 12.288 MHz | 12.288 MHz | 49.152 MHz |

<br>

In this example, the PLL is configured to source the CPU clocks (HFCLK0) and be 3x the peripheral clock. This examples uses the 16-kHz frame rate.


### Firmware overview

The firmware is designed to play a short audio record place in flash (*wave.h/c*) when the kit's button is pressed.

The I2S master init function requires an SPI resource and a Smart I/O resource as arguments. The SPI resource is configured to generate an interrupt when the FIFO is half full. When the I2S master write function is invoked, it writes data to the SPI FIFO until it is full. Once the FIFO level drops to half, it triggers the interrupt and more data is written to the FIFO. The firmware also registers a callback to be executed when the I2S Write operation finishes.

The Smart I/O resource is configured to translate the SPI-SS to I2S-WS signal. It uses the internal LUTs and data unit (DU) to count 32 cycles of the SPI-SCLK, and then toggle the I2S-WS output. It also delays the SPI-MOSI line to match the I2S bit arrangement.


### Resources and settings

**Table 3. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| SCB (SPI) (PDL) | SPI_I2S  | Simulates the I2S master |
| Smart I/O (PDL) | SMARTIO | Used by the I2S master middleware to translate SPI to I2S |
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_BTN         | User button                  |
| GPIO (HAL) | CYBSP_USER_LED | User LED |
| PWM (HAL) | mclk_pwm | Generates the MCLK for the audio codec |
